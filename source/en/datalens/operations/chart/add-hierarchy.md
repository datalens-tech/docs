# Adding a hierarchy

{% note info %}

* You cannot use hierarchies in **Map**, **Indicator**, and **Pivot table** charts.
* You can only add one hierarchy to a chart.

{% endnote %}

To add a hierarchy:



1. On the DataLens home page, click **Create chart**.
1. Under **Dataset**, select a dataset for visualization. If you do not have a dataset, [create it](../dataset/create.md).



1. Select any chart type except **Map**, **Indicator**, and **Pivot table**.
1. To the left of the wizard interface, click **![image](../../../_assets/plus-sign.svg)** and select **Add hierarchy**.
1. Enter the hierarchy name, select dimensions, and arrange them as you see fit.
1. In the bottom-right corner, click **Save**.
1. Drag the created hierarchy to any available section. For example, for the **Table** chart type, you can use the **Columns** section.
1. Drag other dimensions and measures to the appropriate sections.
