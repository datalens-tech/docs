# Workbooks and collections DataLens



DataLens entities are stored in special containers:
* A **workbook** stores connections, datasets, charts, and dashboards. Entities within a workbook may only refer to each other.
* A **collection** is a container used for grouping workbooks and other collections.

To learn more about how to create a workbook or collection, see [{#T}](./workbooks-collections-create.md).
