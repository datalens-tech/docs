# Versioning

Chart versioning means storing the history of chart configuration changes through versions. A list of versions is available to users with the lowest level of **{{ permission-read }}** access to the chart.

{% note info %}

Currently, versioning is only supported for [dataset-based](#dataset-based-charts) charts.

{% endnote %}

To go to the list of versions, click the ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) icon at the top of the screen and select **Change history**.

To select a version from the list, click it. The version number will be displayed in the `revId` parameter in the chart address string. Clicking a link with the version number in the `revId` parameter will open the relevant version of the chart.

When editing within the current version, you can undo/redo any change you have made. To do this, in the top-right part of the screen, click:

* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-ccw-left.svg) to undo a change.
* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-cw-right.svg) to redo a change.

Unsaved changes in the current version are reset:

* When refreshing the page.
* When saving a chart.
* When switching to another version.

## Version types {#version-types}

All versions fall into the following types:

* **Current**: This is the most recently saved version of a chart. All users can see it on dashboards, as well as when directly navigating to charts or opening them for editing from the dashboard context menu. Only one version of a chart can be current.

  If a user has **{{ permission-write }}** permissions, they can make any chart version current.
  
  {% note warning %}
  
  When updating any version, except a draft, a new chart version is created.

  {% endnote %}
  
* **Draft**: This is a version with unsaved chart changes. Common users do not see changes being made to a draft. This enables you to hide chart edits until you release a new version. A chart can only have one draft.

  To create a draft after editing a chart, click the down arrow in the top-right corner and select **Save as draft**.

  You can display a draft version of your chart on the dashboard. To do this, [add](../../operations/chart/add-parameters.md) the `unreleased` parameter set to `1` to the widget parameters on the dashboard for this chart.

* **Outdated**: This is a version that is neither current nor a draft.

{% note tip %}

You can share any chart version by adding the `revId` parameter to the chart link, e.g., `?revId=zac5m4edoaqqr`.

{% endnote %}

## Creating a new version {#version-create}

A new version is automatically created:

* In the current chart version edit mode, after you click **Save** (which creates a new current version) or ![chevron-down](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as draft** (which creates a new draft version).
* In the draft edit mode or non-current chart version edit mode, after you click **Save as draft** (which creates a new draft version) or ![chevron-down](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save and make current** (which creates a new current version).
* In draft or non-current chart version view mode, after you click **Make current**.

You will also get a new version if you change chart configuration as follows:

* Edit the chart settings you can access by clicking ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/gear.svg) at the top of the screen.
* Add, rename, or delete chart fields.
* Add or delete fields in chart sections.

## Limitations {#restrictions}

* The change history only contains a list of chart versions and includes the version type, save date and time, and the author of the edits.
* Chart versions do not include changes to access permissions; this operation is performed separately from chart edits.
* Versions do not display a list of changes. You can only view the saved status of the chart configuration.
