# Versioning

Chart versioning means storing the history of chart configuration changes through versions. A list of versions is available to users with the lowest edit permission for the chart.

To go to the list of versions, click the ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) icon at the top of the screen and select **Change history**.

To select a version from the list, click it. The version number will be displayed in the `revId` parameter in the chart address string. Clicking a link with the version number in the `revId` parameter will open the relevant version of the chart.


When editing within the current version, you can undo/redo any change you have made. To do this, click:

* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-ccw-left.svg) in the top-right corner of the screen or press **Ctrl** (**Cmd**) + **Z** to undo changes.
* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-cw-right.svg) in the top-right corner of the screen or press **Ctrl** (**Cmd**) + **Shift** + **Z** to redo changes.

Unsaved changes in the current version are reset:

* When refreshing the page.
* When saving a chart.
* When switching to another version.

## Version types {#version-types}

All versions fall into the following types:

1. **Current**: This is the most recently saved version of a chart.

   The version is displayed:
   
   * To all users on dashboards.
   * When navigating to a chart.
   * When opening a chart in a workbook.
   * When using the dashboard context menu to open a chart for editing.
   
   Only one chart version can be current.

   A user with **{{ permission-write }}** permissions can make any chart version current.
  
   {% note warning %}
  
   When updating any version, except a draft, a new chart version is created.

   {% endnote %}
  
1. **Draft**: This is a version with unsaved chart changes. Common users do not see changes being made to a draft. This enables you to hide chart edits until you release a new version. A chart can only have one draft. 
   When you open a draft, a panel appears at the top indicating the version type, creation date and time, and login of the version author. There are buttons in the right-hand panel:

   * **Make current**: Turns the draft into the current version. The version current at the time will become outdated.
   * **Open current**: Opens the current version.

   {% cut "Draft" %}
   
   ![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/chart-draft-version.png)

   {% endcut %}

   To create a draft after editing a chart, click the down arrow in the top-right corner and select **Save as draft**.

   If there is a draft version of the chart, you can open it right away if you add the `unreleased=1` parameter to the URL.

   You can display a draft version of your chart on the dashboard. To do this, [add](../../operations/chart/add-parameters.md) the `unreleased` parameter set to `1` to the widget parameters on the dashboard for this chart.

1. **Outdated**: This is a version that is neither current nor a draft.  
   When you open an outdated version, a panel appears at the top indicating the version type, creation date and time, and login of the version author. There are buttons in the right-hand panel:

   * **Make current**: Turns the currently outdated version into the current one. The current version and the draft (if any) will become outdated.
   * **Open current**: Opens the current version.

   {% cut "Outdated version" %}

   {% endcut %}

{% note tip %}

You can share any chart version by adding the `revId` parameter to the chart link, e.g., `?revId=zac5m4edoaqqr`.

{% endnote %}


## Creating a new version {#version-create}

A new version is automatically created:

* In the current chart version edit mode, after you click **Save** (which creates a new current version) or ![chevron-down](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as draft** (which creates a new draft version).
* In the draft edit mode or non-current chart version edit mode, after you click **Save as draft** (which creates a new draft version) or ![chevron-down](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save and make current** (which creates a new current version).
* In draft or non-current chart version view mode, after you click **Make current**.

Chart configuration changes that, after saving, create a new version:

* Editing the chart settings you can access by clicking ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/gear.svg) at the top of the screen.
* Adding, renaming, or deleting chart fields.
* Adding or deleting chart section fields.

## Editing versions {#version-edit}

You can edit any version of a chart.

### Editing a current version {#actual-version-edit}

If a chart has a draft, when you open its current version for editing, you will see a message in the top panel informing there is a draft in the change history.

![image](../../../_assets/datalens/concepts/chart-with-draft-version.png)

Click the following:

* **Open draft**: To navigate to the draft.
* **Show in history**: To display the list of versions.

### Editing a draft {#irrelevant-version-edit}

To edit a draft, select it in the version list. To save your draft edits, at the top right, click:

* **Save as draft**: New draft will be created. The current draft will become an outdated version.
* Click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as copy** to create a new chart.
* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save and make current** to create a new current version and make all other versions outdated.

### Editing an outdated version {#current-version-edit}

To edit an outdated version, select it from the list of versions. To save edits to an outdated version, at the top right, click:

* **Save as draft**: Draft will be created from the edited version. The current draft will become an outdated version.
* Click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as copy** to create a new chart.
* ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save and make current** to create a new current version and make all other versions, including the draft, outdated.

## Limitations {#restrictions}

* You can only get change history for the last three months.
* The change history only contains a list of chart versions and includes the version type, save date and time, and the author of the edits.
* Chart versions do not include changes to access permissions; this operation is performed separately from chart edits.
* Versions do not display a list of changes. You can only view the saved status of the chart configuration.
