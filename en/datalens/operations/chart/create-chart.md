* Go to the workbook page with the chart. In the row with the chart, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/copy.svg) **Duplicate**. In the window that opens, enter a name for the new chart and click **Apply**.

You can also create a draft of the chart by clicking ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as draft** in the upper right corner of the chart. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/chart/versioning.md).
