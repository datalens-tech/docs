# Creating a dashboard in {{ datalens-name }}

To create a dashboard:

1. Go to the [workbook](../../concepts/index.md#workbooks-and-collections) to create a dashboard in.
1. On the workbook page, click **Create** → **Dashboard** in the top-right corner.
1. In the window that opens, enter a name for the dashboard and click **Create**. The dashboard will appear in the list on the navigation page.


## Creating a copy or draft of the dashboard {#create-dashboard-copy}

To create a dashboard copy, use one of these methods:

* In the dashboard editing mode, in the top-right corner, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as copy**. In the window that opens, enter a name for the new dashboard and click **Save**. All changes in the current version will be saved to the new dashboard.
* At the top of the dashboard, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/copy.svg) **Duplicate**. In the window that opens, enter a name for the new dashboard and click **Apply**. This will create a copy of the dashboard’s current version on the server.
* Go to the page of the workbook the dashboard is in. In the row with the dashboard, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) → ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/copy.svg) **Duplicate**. In the window that opens, enter a name for the new dashboard and click **Apply**. This will create a copy of the dashboard’s current version on the server.

You can also create a dashboard draft by clicking ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/chevron-down.svg) → **Save as draft** in the top-right corner in the dashboard editing mode. All changes in the current version will be saved to the dashboard draft. For more information, see [{#T}](../../dashboard/versioning.md).
