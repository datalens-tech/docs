# Workbooks and collections {{ datalens-short-name }}



{{ datalens-short-name }} entities are stored in special containers:

* A **workbook** stores connections, datasets, charts, and dashboards. Entities within a workbook may only refer to each other.
* A **collection** is a container used for grouping workbooks and other collections.

For more information about how to create workbooks or collections, see [{#T}](./workbooks-collections-create.md).
